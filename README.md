ðŸ“ˆ Regression â€” From Scratch
Welcome to my very first Machine Learning project!
This repository is a hands-on implementation of Linear Regression from scratch in Python, built using nothing but NumPy â€” no machine learning libraries, just the math and the logic.

ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s Inside:
âœ… Simple Linear Regression with user-provided CSV inputs

âœ… Multiple Linear Regression using the California Housing dataset from scikit-learn

âœ… Clean, modular, and beginner-friendly structure â€” perfect for learning and tinkering

ðŸ§  Math-Driven, Not Just Code
This project goes beyond code â€” itâ€™s powered by the mathematical foundations of linear regression.
For simple regression, I derived everything manually, applying concepts like the least squares method and gradient descent.
